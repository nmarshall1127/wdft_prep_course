        <p id="first_box" class="box">
            The actual content is 200px wide. The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10
            px top and bottom. It has a dotted border 2px thick.
        </p>
        <p id="second_box" class="box">
            This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the distance between the two boxes
            is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.
